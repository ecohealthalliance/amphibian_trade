This repository contains preliminary analyses of amphibian trade using databases available to EcoHealth Alliance, specifically our curated LEMIS wildlife trade data, accessible through an [in-house R package](https://github.com/ecohealthalliance/lemis). Amphibian trade is closely linked to wildlife disease issues because of the global threat of chytridiomycosis caused by either *Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis* or *Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans*.
